# This file lists all the Python packages and their exact versions required for this project.
# Using specific versions ensures reproducibility across different environments.

# Deep Learning Frameworks and NLP Libraries
tensorflow==2.15.0        # Core deep learning library by Google, enabling neural network creation and training.
tensorflow-hub==0.14.0    # For publishing, discovering, and reusing pre-trained ML modules.
tensorflow-text==2.15.0   # Provides TensorFlow operations for text processing (crucially, version must match core TensorFlow for compatibility).
transformers==4.35.0      # Hugging Face library for state-of-the-art NLP models (like BERT) for model architecture and tokenization.
torch==2.1.0              # PyTorch deep learning framework (often a dependency for Hugging Face Transformers internal operations).

# Data Manipulation and Machine Learning Utilities
pandas==2.0.3             # Fundamental library for data manipulation and analysis using DataFrames.
numpy==1.26.4             # Basic numerical computing library for array operations.
scikit-learn==1.3.0       # Machine learning library for data splitting, preprocessing, and evaluation metrics.

# Visualization Libraries
matplotlib==3.7.2         # Basic plotting library.
seaborn==0.12.2           # High-level statistical data visualization based on Matplotlib.
plotly==5.17.0            # Interactive graphing library for web-based, dynamic plots.

# FastAPI API Development and Server Components
fastapi==0.104.1          # Modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs.
uvicorn==0.24.0           # ASGI server to run FastAPI applications.
pydantic==2.4.2           # Data validation and settings management (used by FastAPI for request/response models).
python-multipart==0.0.6   # Supports handling form data in FastAPI requests.

# Web and Utility Libraries
jinja2==3.1.2             # Powerful templating engine (useful for rendering HTML in web UIs, though not directly used in API core).
aiofiles==23.2.0          # Enables asynchronous file I/O operations (for non-blocking file access in async apps).
python-dotenv==1.0.0      # Loads environment variables from .env files (for secure management of sensitive data like API keys).

# Logging and Rich Terminal Output
loguru==0.7.2             # Simplified and powerful logging library.
rich==13.6.0              # Library for rich text and beautiful formatting in the terminal.

# Streamlit (Optional: Included for convenience as a potential future UI framework)
streamlit==1.28.0         # Open-source framework for building interactive web applications for ML/Data Science.
